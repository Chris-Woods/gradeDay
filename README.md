# Minerva Hacker

Minerva Hacker is a tool intended for make the lives of McGill students a little bit more convenient by dealing with Minerva so they don't have to.

#### GetGrades
This script will regularly check your transcript for changes and notify you via growlnotify if any new grades have been updated.

#### AutoRegister
WIP. This has to be redone completely because the old method of going through quick-add and periodically attempting to register for courses until successful ended up getting people's registration abilities revoked... lol oops.

Intent is to provide a script to periodically check if a course has open spots and if so, register the user, or alternatively add the user to the waitlist if possible.
